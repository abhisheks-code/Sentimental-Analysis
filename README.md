# Sentimental-Analysis

Product analysis is an important aspect of online shopping nowadays. Consumers today need to know the quality of the product they are purchasing online without having the need to go to the store and see it for themselves. A very efficient method of achieving this is peer review done by fellow customers and consumers of the same product. 
	Our portal will host a database of common products and a rating system for each one of the products. Inputs can be made about the quality of each product and popular products will be pushed/advertised on the portal to other consumers.
